				<p style="font-size: 30px">Hello! My name is Gabrielis. Curently, I am a Sophmore student at LCC International
				University in Klaipeda, Lithuania, studying Contemporary Communication. Since from my childhood, I always had a huge
				passion for electronic music, in my free time I love to produce music and do some sound designing
				with Serum(advanced wavetable synthesizer). I have been working with Serum for one year and since I started it, I cannot stop! In my next website page(Serum presets)
                you can find some of the sounds that I made by myself.</p>
